# Amstelvar

### About the Design

Amstelvar is a typeface inspired by the typeface designs used in The Netherlands and Belgium from the sixteenth century to the development of Times Roman in the 1930s.

It is the first public demonstration of the Type Network "Parametric Axes" approach to the OpenType Variable Fonts technology.
